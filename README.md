# MTseveringrepair
This repo contains all the codes used to generate figures in Shiff et al, "Ultrasensitivity of microtubule severing rate on the concentration of free tubulin". 
We theoretically analyze microtubule severing as a competition between the processes of damage spreading and tubulin-induced repair and study its implication on microtubule length control.
